Abstract—The increasing popularity of Cloud computing as an
attractive alternative to classic information processing systems
has increased the importance of its correct and continuous
operation even in the presence of faulty components. In this
paper, we introduce an innovative, system-level, modular perspective on creating and managing fault tolerance in Clouds.
We propose a comprehensive high-level approach to shading
the implementation details of the fault tolerance techniques to
application developers and users by means of a dedicated service
layer. In particular, the service layer allows the user to specify and
apply the desired level of fault tolerance, and does not require
knowledge about the fault tolerance techniques that are available
in the envisioned Cloud and their implementations.
